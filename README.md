# Dining-Philosopher-s-Problem
Dining Philosopher's problem with a variation that a philosopher when picks chopsticks of different colour, then only he/she can eat. 
The program uses system calls to create philosopher. Using fork() system call for creating the processes aka philosophers.
If chopstick of different colour or only a single chopstick is picked up, then philosopher cannot eat.
Afterr All the philosophers have eaten once, the program terminates.
